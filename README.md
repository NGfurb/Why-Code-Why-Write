Well, WHY NOT??? Strap on your stilettos, sharp as TONGUES, smart as CALCULUS, and cut through the mire with your STEELY WORDS and POWERFUL NUMBER SYMBOL COMBOS. Put on your steel-toed shitkickers and charge through the SLOP that your BOTS and your UNIVERSITY and your PRESIDENT are telling you is good enough. IT IS NOT! Grab your pusher broom and shove it off the edge of the world: here there be DRAGONS and SLOP! 

Write and type and try and fail and try again and fix and revise and MAKE until your programs and code and words grow large and vigorous. Leave no pixel or page UNCULTIVATED! 

WHY NOT??? Are you afraid you can't do it? That it won't be good? I tell you now: IT IS GOOD! Do your own words make you CRINGE? Are you FRUSTRATED by your spaghetti code? Are your stories SENSELESS? Do your programs FAIL? I tell you now: THEY ARE GOOD! Good because they are HUMAN BEGINNING of anything you'll ever MAKE.
